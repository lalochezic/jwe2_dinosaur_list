# jwe2_dinosaur_list
A list of dinosaurs players can collect from Jurassic World Evolution 2 formatted into a .csv. Data was collected and collated by [r/Reformater](https://www.reddit.com/user/Reformater/) in [their post on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/jurassicworldevo/comments/r30iz8/spreadsheet_detailing_how_to_unlock_every/). Their data has been made accessible [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TCE6igXMHr_OSvqULKU2dqDBft_v8goaqsdZXiC9xLU/edit?usp=sharing).

I simply downloaded the data and removed the columns containing the legends on the right and wrangled it to produce the data that you can access here. It is in a .csv file in long format, so it can be imported and manipulated into any kind of summary you want.
